# Snake Game in Java

This project is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java using object-oriented programming principles and Java's Swing library for graphical interface development.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
- **Food Collection**: The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- **Collision Detection**: The game detects collisions with the snake's body and walls.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the score, which is the length of the snake.
- **Speed Adjustment**: The game speed increases as the snake eats more food.
- **Game Over Detection**: The game ends if the snake collides with its body or the walls.
